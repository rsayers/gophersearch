-gopherclient.rb: a simple gopher client library
-crawl.rb: A crawler which starts with 1 url and crawls until it finds no
 more, currently hardcoded not to leave my domain
-localsearch: Current local search script running on my site

This is all experiental right now and is nothing more than an exercise in me 
understanding search better.  I do however plan to make this a full live
search engine indexing all of gopherspace.

Ferret is used as the indexing engine as it just works great.  My grand scheme
is to have a pagerank-like system in place to present the most relavent links
first.

The current issue I have is the load it will place on crawling certain sites
with limited resources.  More research is being done on that right now
